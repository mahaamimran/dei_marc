    "description": "Daycare is a facility offered by organizations to support working parents. An in-house daycare facility enables working mothers to focus better on their work responsibilities without feeling the guilt of neglecting their child. Examples of organizations that offer in-house daycare at their head office or larger work sites include Abacus, PPAF, PTCL Group etc. An alternative to on-site daycare is daycare allowance that provides monetary assistance to aid working parents to admit their child in a daycare outside the organizationâ€™s premises such as by Jazz. Another option is to provide nanny allowance so that working parents may hire a nanny who would look after the child at home. Examples of organizations that provide daycare/nanny allowance include Bank Alfalah, HRSG, MMBL etc."
