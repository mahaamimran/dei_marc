    "description":"Another important aspect which facilitates to make the recruitment and selection process unbiased, is having gender balanced interview panels. For example, FINCA Microfinance Bank Limited has a policy to have at least one female in the panel of interviewers. This incorporates female opinion and removes biases. Hashoo Group also ensures the presence of females in interview panels with the aim of making the interview process more inclusive and encouraging for the interviewees. MMBL maintains neutrality in promotion interviews by ensuring female presence in panels along with the mandatory presence of their female CHRO."
