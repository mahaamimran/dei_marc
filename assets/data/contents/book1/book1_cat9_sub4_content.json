    "description": "An employee newsletter of a company is an electronic or printed communications piece that is used by an organization for its internal communication. Some organizations use it to inculcate the organization’s DEI orientation in the minds of all of its employees. For example, FINCA Microfinance Bank Limited publishes success stories (national and international) of female employees in its newsletter including the success stories of females who started their career as branch managers and are currently at the position of regional manager. S&P Global is another organization that uses newsletters to communicate the company’s DEI values and efforts."
