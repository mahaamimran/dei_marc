Meetings are generally conducted in person in an office; however, with the rise of video conferencing technologies, participants can join a business meeting from anywhere. The British Council conducted a series of internal meeting sessions on “Safe Space” in which male and female employees were invited in separate meetings that were moderated by the deputy director and area director (both top-level directors who are managing the operations in Pakistan). Employees shared different problems encountered at the workplace which helped the organization to devise interventions accordingly. Another series of sessions is being conducted by HR, called “Stronger Together,” to help staff open up about their thoughts and feelings about different topics in EDI."
