A policy was devised in 2021 addressing \"How to manage domestic violence beyond the workplace\". It provided complete facilitation to the employee from a perspective of pulling them out of the dreadful situation. This includes giving them housing for a certain period of time, providing them with mental well-being support, arranging lawyers, and providing any other support or assistance they may need. Unilever also launched a campaign which was reflected in their advertisements. A small ad which revolved around becoming \"unmute\" was made, empowering victims to speak up. A phone line was also attached with the Ministry of Human Rights, encouraging women to report domestic violence cases."
