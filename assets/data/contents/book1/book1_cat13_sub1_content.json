The GDEIB 2021 standards provide guidance about the impact of these categories. The standards explain that it is vital for organizations to embed DEI considerations in service and product development. Customers tend to be the most crucial stakeholders for an organization, thus addressing their perceptions and needs sets the tone for how they will engage with the company going forward. It is also integral to ensure that biasness towards females is not reflected in any form in the products or services offered by an organization."

The impact that marketing strategies can have on creating an image of the organization in the consumersâ€™ mind is significant. Truly diverse and inclusive marketing strategies require that a message resonate consciously and subconsciously with the audience, connecting with them on a deeper level. If the customers cannot identify with the message the organization is advertising in its marketing campaigns, retaining them is going to be a challenge. Customer service reflects brand image, mission and core values. All these elements are interconnected. Thus authentic efforts of embedding DEI in customer service are critical."
