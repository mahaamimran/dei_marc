    "description":"Organizations make an effort to ensure that the language used in job-ads remain gender neutral and free of any biases. This ensures a diverse pool of candidates. They try to project an overall supportive culture to attract and retain female talent. Feroze1888 and PPAF are examples of such organizations which ensure that their job advertisements are free of specific gender focus and have gender-inclusive language."
