Unfortunately, many of these efforts do not have a lasting impact, and some could even end up leading to more division in the organization. Mandatory training and public relations campaigns might check a few boxes and satisfy stakeholder expectations, but a culture that supports diversity, equity and inclusion depends on a lot more. It depends on a leader who is willing to do the hard work of evaluating the true nature of their organization and taking the steps to change what they can."

This approach enhances engagement and comprehension, facilitating meaningful behaviour change and promoting a culture of inclusivity within the organization."
