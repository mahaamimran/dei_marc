    "description":"Stereotyping involves making assumptions or generalizations about individuals or groups based on characteristics such as gender, race, or age. These assumptions often ignore individual differences, leading to biased views. In organizational contexts, stereotyping can profoundly impact individuals. It can result in unfair treatment, limited opportunities, and a sense of exclusion for those who do not fit into the stereotypical framework.",
