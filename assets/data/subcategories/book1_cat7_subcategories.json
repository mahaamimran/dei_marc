    "description": "Organizations that have embraced DEI have introduced various benefits and flexible working arrangements for the sound work-life integration for female employees. These efforts facilitate women in pursuing their careers while also catering to their personal needs. The most common benefits are maternity leave, flexible working hours, transport facility/allowance for women, paternity leave, daycare or daycare/nanny allowance, and sabbatical leave. The less commonly offered additional DEI benefits include iddat leave, secure on-site residence or guest houses, enclosure for niqab-wearing women during lunch, scooty loan for women, adoption leave, new mother's adjustment program, and priority parking for women.",
