    "description":"The Foundation group emphasizes a solid DEI base rooted in three pivotal categories. Firstly, there must be a clear DEI vision and strategy, and the business impact of DEI for organizational growth and success must be known and publicized. Secondly, leadership must be accountable, act as DEI role models, and embed DEI into management and oversight responsibilities. Lastly, the organizational structure should have dedicated DEI experts with sufficient authority, access, and resources to champion and implement DEI initiatives effectively. These three foundational categories build a strong DEI initiative and are necessary for the effective operation of all other categories (GDEIB, 2021).",
