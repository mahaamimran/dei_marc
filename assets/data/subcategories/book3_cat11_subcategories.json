    "description":"The gender pay gap refers to the disparity in earnings between women and men; it often establishes from varying assertiveness in salary negotiations as women might not negotiate as aggressively as men for higher salaries or benefits at job starts or performance reviews. Budgetary constraints in implementing gender DEI strategies often stem from limited financial resources allocated for DEI initiatives. This can restrict the scope of activities, such as training programs, outreach efforts, and hiring practices aimed at enhancing gender diversity.",
