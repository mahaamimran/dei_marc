    "description":"The External Group emphasizes how an organization interacts with its broader environment, including customers, communities, and other stakeholders. It highlights the need for proactivity in partnerships, government relations, and philanthropy, ensuring DEI is infused in product/service development, marketing, and customer service. Additionally, the group focuses on responsible and ethical sourcing, especially from underrepresented suppliers, aiming to establish the organization's DEI impact in its external dealings and contributions to society. This group is critically important because it is through an emphasis on these categories that the most direct results of the organization's DEI rationale and business impact will be shown (GDEIB, 2021).",
