    "description":"The Bridging Group connects foundational DEI work with the organization's internal and external objectives. It emphasizes: using assessments, measurements, and research to guide DEI decisions, ensuring aligned strategies; prioritizing clear and inclusive communication to bolster DEI goals; educating stakeholders for comprehensive DEI competence; synergizing DEI with sustainability efforts, enhancing the effectiveness of both, and fostering collaboration across diverse stakeholders. It would be difficult for any of the benchmarks in the other groups to be achieved without effective work in the Bridging Group (GDEIB, 2021).",
