    "description":"The Internal Group emphasizes DEI integration within human resources functions. It focuses on four main categories: recruitment practices are revamped to ensure equitable representation and diminish biases; advancement and retention strategies actively support and promote underrepresented groups, ensuring they feel valued and are proportionally represented; job design, classification, and compensation systems are regularly reviewed to eliminate biases and ensure fair remuneration; work-life balance, flexibility, and benefits cater to diverse needs, fostering a culture of productivity and psychological safety. Many DEI programs emphasize categories in the Internal Group because this group traditionally falls under the human resources function on the organization chart where DEI has typically been placed (GDEIB, 2021).",
