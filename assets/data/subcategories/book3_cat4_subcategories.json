    "description": "Paternity leave is the time off from work that some employers provide to fathers after the birth or adoption of a child, allowing them to care for their newborn or newly adopted child. Maternity leave, on the other hand, is time off granted to mothers for childbirth and to care for their infant. Both types of leave are crucial for bonding with the child, promoting family well-being, and ensuring the health of the mother and child post-delivery.",
